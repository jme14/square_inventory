This is a script that allows for dynamically creating a csv based on items from a square library.

## Usage 
1) Fill the restock_categories.txt file with the names of categories you wish to keep track of 
+ Make sure the names are correct, upon changing a category name the file will need editing 

2) Edit dates.txt to define the date range
+ Format YYYY-MM-DD
+ Both dates are inclusive

3) run `python main.py`

4) in the prior_records directory, find your spreadsheet!
